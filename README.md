## For site developers

### Build and run locally

This site is built in [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/), and uses Vue/JavaScript for functional code and Markdown for post content.

To build a local copy, run the following:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/protocol/nft-website.git
   ```

1. Move into the `nft-website` folder and install the NPM dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd nft-website
   npm install
   ```

1. Boot up the application in _dev mode_:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

1. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
1. Close the local server with `CTRL` + `c`.
1. To restart the local server, run `npm start` from within the `nft-website` folder.

### PR and preview

Once you're happy with your local changes, please make a PR **against the `main` branch**. Including detailed notes on your PR - particularly screenshots to depict any changes in UI - will help speed up approval and deployment.

All PRs against `main` automatically generate Fleek previews to make it easier to "check your work". You can view your PR's preview by clicking `Details` in the `fleek/build` check at the bottom of your PR page:<br/>

A reviewer will be by shortly to have a look!
