# Understanding NFTs on Solana

This guide will help you to learn the basic of tokens on Solana through building a decentralized NFT marketplace on the Solana network and interact with it using the JavaScript client and briefly segue into [launching NFT marketplace on Metaplex](#launch-on-metaplex) for non-developers or those who prefer to Ship Fast<sup>â„¢</sup>. It does not assume prior knowledge of Solana, although it does assume some basic programming in [Rust](https://rustlang.org). For some seasoned developers--be warned--A good chunk of theory will be missing in favor of practical hacking spirit. You're encouraged to dive deeper by reading [How Solana Works](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/overview) and  [Programming on Solana - An Introduction
](https://paulx.dev/blog/2021/01/14/programming-on-solana-an-introduction/), and the [whitepaper](http://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf).

As a result, after you've completed this tutorial, you will have built a decentralized NFT marketplace that will you to mint and transfer your own NFTs to accounts in exchange of SOL payments without relying on any central exchange and learned to faster way of launching your NFTs on Metaplex.

## The basic of Solana

Solana is an innovative blockchain with some key innovations such as [Proof of History (POH)](https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274) and parallel smart contracts run-time to achieve faster, near-instant consensus.

Solana smart contracts are called programs. On Solana, **everything is a program** all the way down. The System Program owns all SOL accounts and other programs, including the Token Program and user-space programs written by us developers.

The focus of this tutorial will be the Token Program in order to understand how to build an NFT program, but in the process it hopefully will give you a better understanding of the platform over all.

## Setting up

To begin this journey, first install:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Use one of the later LTS versions)

Run a test validator locally using the newly install CLI with

```shell
solana-test-validator
> Ledger location: test-ledger
> Log: test-ledger/validator.log
> Identity: 9U8Yk9fEq6hCvaDVtLSSFk5keJUpNutydW1f8LvfAHJf
> Genesis Hash: 5JLFXnecEaDHkkPZRbcN8LoGDPiz6QNLpKDLnB5JA6CF
> Version: 1.8.2
> Shred Version: 44427
> Gossip Address: 127.0.0.1:1024
> TPU Address: 127.0.0.1:1027
> JSON RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8899
> â ¦ 00:01:29 | Processed Slot: 181 | Confirmed Slot: 181 | Finalized Slot: 149 | S
```

Note the JSON RPC URL listening port. Target the running validator node with the Solana CLI:

```shell
solana config set --url http://127.0.0.1:8899
> Config File: /Users/pancy/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
> RPC URL: http://localhost:8899
> WebSocket URL: ws://localhost:8900/ (computed)
> Keypair Path: /Users/pancy/.config/solana/id.json
> Commitment: confirmed
```

Now create a Node project we will be using to interact with our on-chain token program by typing the following:

```shell
mkdir filet
cd filet
npm init -y
npm install @solana/web3.js
```

Let's trying to connect to the running Solana validator on port 8899 as a client using the Node REPL by typing the following:

```shell
node --experimental-repl-await
> Welcome to Node.js v14.18.1.
>> const { Connection } = await import("@solana/web3.js")
>> const connection = new Connection("http://localhost:8899", "confirmed")
>> const version = await connection.getVersion()
>> version["solana-core"]
> '1.8.2'
```

If the version was printed out on the prompt for you, you are successfully connected.

## Create an account

Next, are going to create a keypair that will serves as our "wallet"<sup>1</sup>. Still on the Node REPL, import `Keypair` class from `web3.js` module and create a new keypair:

```shell
>> const { Keypair } = await import("@solana/web3.js")
>> const address = keypair.publicKey.toString()
>> const secret = JSON.stringify(Array.from(keypair.secretKey))
>> address
> '6xnUqt2DXQjqN6ub3ZeT2gAqhtZzA7EMwztx5LhjmJB9'
>> secret
> '...'
```

Your address is a ED25519 publickey and is supposed to be shared in the open to receive tokens. The secret, however, should be kept in a secret place known only to you.

Take note of the address and the secret, as we will be using them for the rest of the tutorial.

## Fund the account

Let's get some (test) SOL airdropped to our account so we can start making transactions. On Solana localnet and devnet, you can request these airdrops for free since the fund can't be used on the mainnet. Make sure you instantiated a `Connection` previously, then proceed to request 1 SOL or 1,000,000,000 Lamports (the value of the constant `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL`) and check the account's balance at the end:

```shell
>> const { PublicKey, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } = await import("@solana/web3.js")
>> const publicKey = new PublicKey(address)
>> const txhash = await connection.requestAirdrop(publicKey, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL)
>> await connection.confirmTransaction(txhash)
>> const balance = await connection.getBalance(publicKey)
>> balance
> '1000000000'
```

Now let's practice transferring some Lamports to another address. To do that, we will have to create a new keypair with a new address to receive the fund. Can you figure this out? (Hint: Repeat [creating an account](#create-an-account))

After you have created a new account and take note of the address and secret, save the address to `recipientAddress` and use the `SystemProgram` and `Transaction` classes to construct a transaction for the transfer:

```shell
>> const recipientAddress = 'NEW_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS'
>> const { SystemProgram, Transaction, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = await import("@solana/web3.js")

>> const fromPubkey = new PublicKey(address)
>> const toPubkey = new PublicKey(recipientAddress)
>> const secretKey = Uint8Array.from(JSON.parse(secret as string))
>> const instructions = SystemProgram.transfer({
    fromPubkey,
    toPubkey,
    lamports,
})
>> const signers = [
  {
    publicKey: fromPubkey,
    secretKey,
  },
]
>> const transaction = new Transaction().add(instructions)
>> const hash = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, signers)
```

Now you are ready to interact with the on-chain program on the client.

## SPL Token Program

In Solana, the predefined token program takes care of the minting, transferring, and burning of all fungible and non-fungible tokens. Unlike Ethereum, there is no need to deploy a smart contract to define a token. All we have to do is create an account that can mint a certain type of tokens (e.g. the token owner), and more accounts that can receive them.

Think of the Token Program as an API to which we can send an [instruction](#anatomy-of-an-instruction) to mint, transfer, or burn tokens. Think of an instruction as a payload in a transaction request to the Token Program API.

Because of this, there are several excellent resources on creating tokens using `spl-cli` command line tool which wraps the Token Program API such as [this one](https://pencilflip.medium.com/solanas-token-program-explained-de0ddce29714) (which is highly recommended). However, in this tutorial, we will be interacting with the Token Program in Rust to get you familiar with building a Solana program and integrating NFTs with it.

## Anatomy of an instruction

Solana is heavily inspired by low-level system programming and focused on performance. Therefore, instruction format is in a form of contiguous byte arrays instead of a more readable format like JSON. However, we will make this easier with the help of the `borsh` crate in Rust, which helps in serializing and deserializing binary instructions to and from Rust data structures. For Rustaceans, the crate will be familiar to you because of its similarities to the `serde` crate.



## Creating an NFT program

Start a project with `cargo new filet --lib` (Feel free to name your project anything, but in this tutorial we will use "filet") Then open the project's manifest file `filet/Cargo.toml` and add:

```toml
[features]
no-entrypoint = []

[dependencies]
solana-program = "=1.10.2"
borsh = "=0.9.4"
spl-token = { version = "3.3.0", features = ["no-entrypoint"] }

[dev-dependencies]
solana-sdk = "=1.10.2"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "lib"]
```

Pay special attention to the `[features]` and `[lib]` attributes. Solana programs aren't allowed to have a normal `main` entrypoint and should be created as a library with `--lib` instead of a standalone binary app.

Run `cargo update` within the project directory to update the dependencies.

Use an editor to open your project and navigate to the `/src/lib.rs`, remove all the existing code, and add the following to the file:

```rust
use solana_program::{
  msg, entrypoint, entrypoint::ProgramResult,
};

entrypoint!(process_instruction);
fn process_instruction(
  program_id: &Pubkey,
  accounts: &[AccountInfo],
  instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
  todo!("Not yet know what I'm doing");
}
```
