 # NFT basics

**NFT** stands for non-fungible token, which doesn't explain very much. This page will try to define what an NFT actually is in the abstract, while also looking at a few specific examples of NFT applications and use cases.

First, let's break down the name. Before we get into "non-fungible," what do we mean by "token"? For our purposes, a token is a kind of record in an information system called a blockchain. We won't get into all the details of how blockchains work here; check out [Blockchains and NFTs](./blockchains.md) for that. To understand what an NFT is, we just need a little background knowledge.

### A bit of history

The most famous blockchain is the one that coined the term. Bitcoin's [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) introduced a "chain of blocks" to track and secure the history of the system over time, and the term "blockchain" caught on as new networks built on the idea. The Bitcoin network has a single token, named "Bitcoin." 

Like traditional cash, Bitcoin is _fungible_, meaning you can replace one Bitcoin with another Bitcoin without changing the value of either. In fact, at a technical level, there's not really such a thing as "a single Bitcoin" with its own identity. Whereas cash at least might have a serial number to distinguish one bill from another, the Bitcoin network doesn't track coins individually and assign them each an identifier. Instead, the system just keeps track of the quantity in each account, crediting one account and debiting another with each transaction.

Bitcoin inspired a host of other blockchains that iterated on the same basic idea and introduced new capabilities. The most significant for NFTs was Ethereum, where the concept of NFTs was first developed. Ethereum added general purpose computation to the blockchain consensus model pioneered by Bitcoin, positioning itself as a "world computer" enabling "programmable money." 

Ethereum has a "native" token called Ether, which is used as both a store of value and to pay for computation in the form of fees called "gas." Like Bitcoin, Ether is fungible. However, the smart contract computation model allows developers to create their own tokens, which can have special properties according to the logic in the contract. 

Most early smart contracts defined fungible tokens similar to Ether, but people quickly began experimenting with using tokens to contain data, making each token unique and distinguishable from the rest. The result is a token that can't easily be exchanged with another arbitrary token of the same type, or a non-fungible token. 

### What makes a token non-fungible?

Earlier we mentioned serial numbers as a way to distinguish one dollar bill from another. Even though you can tell them apart, two dollar bills are still fungible, because they each have the same value as currency. A unique identifier alone is not enough to make something non-fungible.

However, a dollar bill that's been sketched on by Picasso is unique in a way that has nothing to do with serial numbers. By using it as a medium for artwork, our imaginary Picasso has made the bill less fungible. While you could technically redeem it for a dollar's worth of snacks, the exchange value of the bill is now far greater than one dollar.

In the same way, by allowing each token to contain a small amount of arbitrary data, NFTs become a medium for creative expression, as well as a unit of exchange and account. The value of an NFT is thus highly dependent on the data it contains and represents. The same NFT may be valued completely differently by different people, based on factors like aesthetic taste or the identity of the creator.

### What are NFTs good for?

There's a good reason we don't conduct business by swapping priceless Picasso sketches around! Without fungibility, an NFT isn't much good as currency. 

So what are NFTs used for, and what makes them different from other digital records? 

TODO: use cases.

### Who is using NFTs?

TODO: broad overview of the state of NFT "ecosystem". Link to a few examples of marketplaces, gaming platforms, etc. Not exhaustive - should just give a few examples for each primary use case.
