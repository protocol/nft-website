 # NFT basics

**NFT** stands for non-fungible token, which doesn't explain very much. This page will try to define what an NFT actually is in the abstract, while also looking at a few specific examples of NFT applications and use cases.

First, let's break down the name. Before we get into "non-fungible," what do we mean by "token"? For our purposes, a token is a kind of record in an information system called a blockchain. 

The most famous blockchain is the one that coined the term. Bitcoin's [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) introduced a "chain of blocks" to track and secure the history of the system over time, and the term caught on as new networks built on the idea. The Bitcoin network has a single token, namely "Bitcoin". Like traditional cash, Bitcoin is _fungible_, meaning you can replace one Bitcoin with another Bitcoin without changing the value of either. In fact, at a technical level, there's not really such a thing as "a single Bitcoin" with its own identity. Whereas cash at least might have a serial number to distinguish one bill from another, the Bitcoin network doesn't track coins individually and assign them identifiers. Instead, the system just keeps track of the quantity in each account, crediting one account and debiting another with each transaction.

Bitcoin inspired a host of other blockchains that iterated on the same basic idea and introduced new capabilities. The most significant for NFTs was Ethereum, where the concept of NFTs was first developed. Ethereum added general purpose computation to the blockchain consensus model pioneered by Bitcoin, positioning itself as a "world computer" powered by "programmable money." 

Ethereum's "native" token, Ether, is fungible like Bitcoin. However, the smart contract computation model allows developers to create their own tokens, which can have special properties according to the logic in the contract.
